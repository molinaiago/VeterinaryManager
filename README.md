# VeterinaryManager
 The project was conceived as a total solution for the university's veterinary medicine, where the only method to schedule a cat or dog castration was by calling. When we presented this solution, the veterinary sector liked and approved the idea, so we managed to have a solution to a social problem.
The idea of the application is to be simple and brief, where the focus is that the customer has the best and fastest possible experience using the app. With an interface designed to be straight to the point, with a registration and login screen, a home screen where some information can be found and a scheduling screen, where the customer will have to inform the animal that he wants to be castrated and the date that he wants (it will have to be a date available in the app).
