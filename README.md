# VeterinaryManager
 The project was conceived as a total solution for the university's veterinary medicine, where the only method to schedule a cat or dog castration was by calling. When we presented this solution, the veterinary sector liked and approved the idea, so we managed to have a solution to a social problem.
The idea of the application is to be simple and brief, where the focus is that the customer has the best and fastest possible experience using the app. With an interface designed to be straight to the point, with a registration and login screen, a home screen where some information can be found and a scheduling screen, where the customer will have to inform the animal that he wants to be castrated and the date that he wants (it will have to be a date available in the app).
Sure, I'll separate the conversation information and requirements for building the app into bullet points for you:

**Conversation Information:**

1. **Diversified Service:**
    - The idea is to offer service both privately and through the Single Registry.
    - The Cadastro Único is referred to as "NIS" for low-income people.

2. **Service Availability:**
    - Attendance does not occur every day and sometimes there are schedule conflicts.

3. **Date and Time Scheduling:**
    - Want to control scheduling, allowing them to set the date and time for appointments.

4. **User Scheduling Information:**
    - Users will receive information about the scheduled date and time.

5. **Choice of Registration Type:**
    - There will be an option in the register to choose between "Cadastro Único (NIS)" or private.

6. **Explanation about NIS:**
    - If the user chooses the NIS, display a warning explaining what it is, to avoid confusion for high-income people.

7. **Animal Registration:**
    - Users must be able to register information about their animals.
    - Information includes gender, type of animal (dog or cat), age and size (small, medium, large, in the case of dogs).

**Mobile App Requirements:**

1. **Registration Page:**
    - Name, CPF, Address, e-mail and password are required for registration.
    - Include option to choose between Cadastro Único (NIS) or private.

2. **Login Page:**
    - Allow users to login using their credentials.

3. **Neutering Information Page:**
    - Show relevant information about the castration process.

4. **Scheduling Page:**
    - Allow users to view their schedule and schedule castrations.
    - Request information about the animal: sex, type (dog/cat), age and size.

5. **Scheduling Notification:**
    - Send notifications to users with details of scheduled date and time.

6. **NIS Explanation Page:**
    - If the user chooses the NIS, provide clear information about its purpose.

7. **Animal Registration:**
    - When booking, the animal is registered, including sex, type, age and size.

8. **Friendly Design:**
    - Ensure an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users.

9. **Advanced Scheduling Features:**
    - Allow professionals to control the scheduling of dates and times.

10. **Mobile Compatibility:**
     - The application must be optimized for mobile devices.

11. **Visual Feedback:**
     - Provide visual indicators of success after each action such as scheduling.

12. **Secure Registration and Login:**
     - Implement security measures to protect registration and login data.

13. **Profile Management:**
     - Allow users to update their animal information and records.

14. **Help Resources:**
     - Include FAQ and support section to help users.

Keep in mind that these topics cover requirements and important information for building the app based on the conversation provided. Be sure to adapt these requirements to the specific needs of the project and users.
